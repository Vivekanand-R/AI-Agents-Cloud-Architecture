**Cloud Project 3: Climate Science / Earth System Science Application: Design and Development of AI-Agent Systems for Climate Change Modeling and Policy Simulation** (Part of Roadmap)

**Description:** This system provides AI-driven modeling of **climate change impacts**, capturing complex interactions across Earth systems. It enables simulation of mitigation and adaptation strategies under different climate scenarios. The goal is to support faster, more informed climate decisions through scalable, intelligent modeling.

A. GPU/TPU Compute: Use cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) with GPU/TPU instances for training and simulation.

B. Scalable Storage: Store large climate datasets using S3 or GCS with DVC for version control.

C. Distributed Processing: Use Dask or Spark for efficient data preprocessing and simulation scaling.

D. Experiment Tracking: Track models with MLflow or Weights & Biases for reproducibility.

E. Containerization: Use Docker and Kubernetes for agent deployment and orchestration.

F. Data Access APIs: Integrate remote datasets via OPeNDAP, RESTful APIs, or Earthdata.

G. Cloud-Native Architecture: Design with microservices and auto-scaling for flexibility.

H. CI/CD Pipelines: Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

I. Security & IAM: Enforce access controls, encryption, and audit logging.

J. Visualization: Dashboards with Streamlit or Grafana for insights and monitoring.
