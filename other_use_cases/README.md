# AI Agents

 **Other Industrial Applications and Use Cases of Agentic AI:**

**6. Predictive Maintenance Agent:** (A commercially viable solution)

Consumes sensor logs from turbines, transformers, or imaging CT/MRI healthcare machines. Predicts failure using temporal models (e.g., transformer oil analytics + vibration + image logs + Sensor + temperature). Alert customers and field on time without any human interventions involved. 

**7. Digital Twin Control Agent** (Concept of digital twins has already seen heavy investment and mainstream adoption in the past, this agent focuses on a fresh angle: **simulating what-if scenarios**)

Simulates physical assets (gas turbines, wind farms, healthcare equipments) to test **what-if scenarios** for performance tuning, lifetime extension, or policy compliance. Auto identify the root casue and fix the product issues. 

Data Readiness & QA Agent: Evaluates data pipelines, spots data drift, missingness, schema violations, and alerts teams before models fail downstream.

**8. Auto-Dashboarding Agent** (Under-estimated Idea, but has great potential in Business Intelligence World, if successful it will be helpful for atleast 1M+ BI developers and users in the below pyramid)

Connects to Snowflake/Databricks/DataLake, builds dynamic BI dashboards with natural language prompts, including forecasting and anomaly explanations. And, do a better predictions/forecasting for commercial team.

**9. Investment Research Agent: Autonomous Decision-Makers & Planners**

Analyzes real-time data, economic indicators, and sentiment for portfolio suggestions. Autonomous Decision-Makers & Planners. Simulates a person’s decision-making for training or automation (e.g., for leadership teams, investors).
